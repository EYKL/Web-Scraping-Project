# Web-Scraping-Project
NBA Stats

In this project I collected data from the 2022/2023 NBA Season as practice project. Data for the season totals of stats were scaped from Basketball-Reference.com.  
The data was cleaned and saved in stages as .csv.
The per game statistics were calulated and new columns were added to the data set.
Leauge average was calculated and a new dateframe was formed.  The statistics for league mvp Joel Embiid was put into a dateframe.
A bar plot was used to show MVP vs Leauge Average performance. 

The work was done in the Jupyter notebook. The python file can be run to collect the data and save the plot.
